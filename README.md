# Memory Game in Vanilla JS

## What
In case the title isn't enough, this is a memory game in vanilla javascript. The user clicks on two cards at a time. If the images revealed are the same, the user gets the pair. You know how this goes.

## Why
This is to keep the vanilla side fresh and to have an excuse to use Procreate to make my own images. Since that will take time, I do not want the logic to drag me down. Don't drag me down, man. Since the images will be kept at a small size, I am keeping it raster (Procreate) and not vector (Affinity Design).

## How this helped me
As an English speaker who majored in German, I can connect JS to learning and maintaining a language other than one's first. I have found that by focusing on React after work and jQuery at work (god save me), I lose the basics of Javascript. If I were to focus on business German, I might not be able to chat about other things if in a conversation with someone on the bus or a neighbour. Fachsprachen / technical languages or industry-specific languages are important as they have their unique jargon, lingo, etc., but you shouldn't lose track of the fact that there's more to the language. 

This was also a reminder that even the simplest game in real life has intricacies we take for granted until we are coding this. While that peanut-butter-sandwich challenge shown in all dev or cs intro classes gets old and is probably unwise when so many people have allergies, it really does hammer in the point that what we do in real life involves more than what we think about until we have to code it.

Keep track of previous guesses. If two or three in a row, change message.
* Keep track of wins and losses
