# Memory Game in Vanilla JS

## What
In case the title isn't enough, this is a memory game in vanilla javascript. The user clicks on two cards at a time. If the images revealed are the same, the user gets the pair. You know how this goes.

## Why
This is to keep the vanilla side fresh and to have an excuse to use Procreate to make my own images. Since that will take time, I do not want the logic to drag me down. Don't drag me down, man. Since the images will be kept at a small size, I am keeping it raster (Procreate) and not vector (Affinity Design).

## What next
Set timeout allows eyes to catch and not have messages flash, but user can still click. Work on that.
Resetting after 3 seconds after game is complete, like it or not. Let user choose to replay.
Fail messages just random. Look at # of tries. Have level of snark inc as tries inc. 
Keep track of previous guesses. If two or three in a row, change message.
